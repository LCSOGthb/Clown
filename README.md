Overview
Clown is a playful, AI-driven web game deployed through Netlify. The project’s continuous deployment pipeline automatically builds and deploys code changes from our main repository branch. This ensures any new features, bug fixes, or AI updates get delivered to users quickly.

Key Features
AI-Powered Gameplay

Incorporates machine learning (ML) models to adapt challenges and clown behaviors based on player performance.
Seamless Deployment

Netlify handles all build and deployment steps, making it easy to roll out new features or roll back if issues occur.
Live Monitoring

Netlify’s dashboard provides real-time deployment logs. Developers can quickly spot build errors or integration problems.

Known Issues & Roadmap
AI Model Limitations
The clown’s reaction logic may behave unexpectedly for edge cases. We plan to refine our ML model to handle extremes more gracefully.
Mobile Responsiveness
The UI is partially optimized for mobile but needs additional tweaks for smaller screens.
