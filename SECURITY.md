Security Policy
This document outlines the versions of our project that receive security updates, as well as how to responsibly report vulnerabilities.

Supported Versions
Version	Supported?
5.1.x	✅ (Active security updates)
5.0.x	❌ (No longer supported)
4.0.x	✅ (Limited security fixes)
< 4.0	❌ (No longer supported)
Notes
Major releases (e.g., 5.1.x, 4.0.x) typically receive security fixes for at least 12 months from their initial release date.
Once a version is no longer supported, we strongly recommend upgrading to a supported release to maintain security.
Reporting a Vulnerability
We strive to resolve all valid security issues as quickly and transparently as possible. If you believe you’ve found a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. Initial Contact
Email our security team: security@yourproject.org
In your email, include:
The version(s) of the project affected
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
Potential impact of the issue
A suggested fix or patch if available
2. Acknowledgment & Timeline
We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days, confirming receipt and letting you know we’ve begun investigating.
Our goal is to provide a follow-up or resolution within 7–14 business days. However, complex issues may take longer.
3. Response & Disclosure
If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will:
Develop a fix or mitigation strategy
Thoroughly test the patch
Coordinate a release timeframe
Once a patch is ready, we’ll:
Publish a security advisory (for example, using GitHub Security Advisories or our official website)
Promptly release new versions in all supported branches
4. Public Disclosure
We request that you withhold public disclosure of the vulnerability until we have completed our investigation and any necessary fixes.
We will credit reporters in our advisories, unless anonymity is requested.
