This document outlines the versions of our project that receive security updates, as well as how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

Supported Versions
Version	Supported?
5.1.x	✅ (Active security updates)
5.0.x	❌ (No longer supported)
4.0.x	✅ (Limited security fixes)
< 4.0	❌ (No longer supported)
Notes:

Major releases (e.g., 5.1.x, 4.0.x) typically receive security fixes for at least 12 months from their initial release date.
When a version is no longer supported, we strongly recommend upgrading to a supported release to remain secure.
Reporting a Vulnerability
We strive to resolve all valid security issues swiftly and transparently. Here’s how you can report a vulnerability:

Initial Contact

Email our security team at: security@yourproject.org
Please include as many details as possible:
Project version(s) affected
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
Any potential impact
Suggested fix or patch if available
Acknowledgment & Timeline

We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days, letting you know we’ve received it and have begun investigation.
We aim to provide a follow-up or resolution within 7–14 business days, though complex issues may take longer.
Response & Disclosure

If the vulnerability is confirmed, we’ll work with you to:
Develop a fix or mitigation strategy
Test the patch
Coordinate a release timeframe
Once a patch is ready, we will publish a security advisory (e.g., via GitHub Security Advisories or our official website) and promptly release new versions in all supported branches.
Public Disclosure

We request that you withhold public disclosure of the vulnerability until we have had the opportunity to investigate and create any necessary fixes.
We will credit reporters who wish to be recognized in our security advisories, unless anonymity is requested.
